# Reversi Game - Developed in Python 

Simple overview of use/purpose
## Description

This project was carried out in my first semester, for the course unit of Discrete Mathematics and Programming.

## Getting Started

Reversi is a strategy board game for two players, played on an 8Ã—8 uncheckered board. It was invented in 1883. Othello, a variant with a fixed initial setup of the board, was patented in 1971. 

This was the first windows game, introduced in Windows 1.0.
